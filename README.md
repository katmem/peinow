# PeiNow Project - A Web-based System for Ordering Products, using NoSQL Database Technologies
This project was built using Django, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery. It is a web application used for online food ordering and allows users to select their preferred date and 
time for picking up their order. Users can create an account, login, search for restaurants in the city of their choice, add items to their cart and select pickup time. Restaurants can also 
create an account, add their menu, get notified when new orders are placed and either accept or reject them.
